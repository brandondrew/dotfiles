;;; Commentary:

;; ModeUnit builds on top of ElUnit to provide higher-level tests to
;; be written.  Specifically it's focused on tests for Emacs modes
;; rather than lower level Emacs Lisp functions.

;; To this end it is mostly a collection of helper functions (for
;; buffer setup) and higher-level assertions that handle the kind of
;; thing major modes are usually concerned with, like font-lock and
;; indentation.  So ModeUnit tests end up looking a lot like ElUnit
;; tests; see the documentation for that library for some examples.

;; The main difference is that each ModeUnit suite is bound to the
;; context of a given file and mode.  So in addition to elunit's
;; defsuite, you may use mode-unit-suite to define a suite that always
;; loads up a file in a fresh buffer and invokes a mode before running
;; each of its tests:

;; (defsuite my-mode-suite default-suite ;; ancestor of default.
;;   "foo-sample.my" my-mode)

;; Note: ModeUnit expects to be run in a clean "emacs -Q" invocation.
;; The rationale behind this is that it's very easy to write modes
;; that accidentally rely on functions defined somewhere in your
;; custom Emacs config, but your mode should be usable independently;
;; only relying on what it explicitly requires.  So to run ModeUnit you
;; would use something like:

;;  $ emacs -Q -l my-mode-unit-test.el

;; or better yet:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-m")
;;                 (shell-command "emacs -Q -l my-mode-unit-test.el"))
;; TODO: figure out how to non-block w/o async output buffer

;; You would want to include an invokation of elunit with your given
;; suite at the bottom of your test file.

;;; TODO:

;; - defsuite assumes tests do not open new buffers.

;;; Code:

(require 'elunit)

(defstruct test-suite name children tests
  setup-hooks teardown-hooks file mode)

(elunit-clear-suites) ;; so default-suite is a struct of the same definition

(defmacro* mode-unit-suite (suite-name suite-ancestor file mode
				       &key setup-hooks teardown-hooks)
  "Create a test suite with extra mode-unit hooks."
  `(let ((suite (defsuite ,suite-name ,suite-ancestor
		  :setup-hooks (cons (lambda () (find-file (test-suite-file suite))
				       (funcall (test-suite-mode suite)))
				     ,setup-hooks)
		  :teardown-hooks (cons (lambda () (kill-buffer nil)) ,teardown-hooks))))
     (setf (test-suite-file suite) ,file)
     (setf (test-suite-mode suite) ',mode)))
