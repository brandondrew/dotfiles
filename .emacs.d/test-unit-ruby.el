;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides ruby-specific functions to integrate with
;; `test-unit-mode'.

;; For now it relies on ruby-mode, which should come with your ruby
;; distribution and is slated to be included in the next Emacs
;; release. If you don't have it, you can get it from the Ruby SVN
;; repository: http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/misc/

;; For ruby-mode it adds a hook that will try to determine if a buffer
;; contains unit tests and switch to test-unit-mode if it does. It
;; also requires that the "turn" library be installed. It's packaged
;; as a gem, but it needs to be installed in your load path. In Debian
;; and derivatives the place it goes is /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8/

;; See test-unit.el for details. See also test-unit-autotest.el for
;; smarter invokation rules.
