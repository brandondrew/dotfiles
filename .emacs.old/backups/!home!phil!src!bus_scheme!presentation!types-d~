          Strings are almost just like Ruby.
            (double-quoted only, no interpolation.)

          Symbols are just identifiers, but generally
            you need to quote them.

              :foo => (quote foo)
              :foo => 'foo ;; Shorthand

          Functions are lambda literals, similar to Ruby's.

              Proc.new {|a, b| a + b } => (lambda (a b) (+ a b))
