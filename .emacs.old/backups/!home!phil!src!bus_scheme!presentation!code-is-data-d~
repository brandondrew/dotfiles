    Fundamentals of Metaprogramming:

        CODE   is   DATA.


      But that's ugly!

        Because Ruby's syntax is not optimized for it.

  [:def, :rest, [:if [[:self, :length], :==, 1],
                 [:return, nil],
                 :else,
                 [:self, :[], 1, [:self, :length]]]]
