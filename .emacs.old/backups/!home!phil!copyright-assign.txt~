One way all of you can assign copyright to the Foundation is if each
of you signs a copy of the assignment contract below.

In addition, for each of you, if you are employed to do programming
(even at a university), or have made an agreement with your employer
or school saying it owns programs you write, then you and we need a
signed piece of paper from your employer or school, disclaiming rights
to the program.

The disclaimer should be signed by a vice president or general manager
of the company.  If you can't get at them, anyone else authorized to
license software produced there will do.  Here is a sample wording:

 Digital Stimulation Corporation hereby disclaims all copyright interest
 in the program "seduce" (a program to direct assemblers to make passes
 at compilers under GNU Emacs) written partly by Hugh Heffner,
 including both the present version and his/her future changes and
 enhancements to it.  We do not consider it or them as a work made
 for hire for us.


 Digital Stimulation Corporation affirms that it has no other
 intellectual property interest that would undermine this release,
 and will do nothing to undermine it in the future.

 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1987
 Ty Coon, President of Vice, Digital Stimulation Corp.

(If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim
that could conflict with the use of the program, then please put me in
touch with a suitable representative of the company, so that we can
negotiate what to do about it.)

The description of what the program does is just to make it clearer
what the disclaimer covers.

IMPORTANT: When you talk to your employer, *no matter what
instructions they have given you*, don't fail to show them the sample
disclaimer above, or a disclaimer with the details filled in for your
specific case.  Companies are usually willing to sign a disclaimer
without any fuss.  If you make your request less specific, you may
open Pandora's box and cause a long and unnecessary delay.

Below is the assignment contract that we usually use.  You would need
to print it out, sign it, and snail it to:

Richard Stallman
77 Mass Ave rm 32-381
Cambridge MA 02139
USA

Please try to print the whole first page below on a single piece of
paper.  If it doesn't fit on one printed page, put it on two sides of
a single piece of paper.

Don't forget to put down the date when you sign!  Spell out the month
name--don't use a number for the month.  Dates using a number for the
month are ambiguous; 2/8/95 means one thing in the US and another in
Europe.

Snail a copy of the employer's disclaimer as well.

Please send me email about what you decide to do.  If you have any
questions, or would like something to be changed, ask rms@gnu.org via email.
                            ASSIGNMENT

  For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which we acknowledge,
we, Yukihiro Matsumoto and Nobuyoshi Nakada, hereby transfer to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc.  (the "Foundation") our entire right, title, and
interest (including all rights under copyright) in our computer program
ruby-mode.el (the "Program"), subject to the conditions below.  The work
hereby assigned shall further include any future changes and/or
enhancements hereafter made by us.

  Upon thirty days' prior written notice(s), the Foundation agrees to
grant to any one or more, or all, of us non-exclusive rights to use the
Program as we see fit; (and the Foundation's rights shall otherwise
continue unchanged).

  For the purposes of this contract, a work "based on the Program"
means any work that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived
from all or part of the Program.

  The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Program, or of any
work "based on the Program", that takes place under the control of the
Foundation or its agents or assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly
and perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the
terms apply, and possessing accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute
copies of the work to anyone on the same terms.  These terms shall not
restrict which members of the public copies may be distributed to.  These
terms shall not require a member of the public to pay any royalty to the
Foundation or to anyone else for any permitted use of the work they apply
to, or to communicate with the Foundation or its agents in any way either
when redistribution is performed or on any other occasion.

  The Foundation promises that any program "based on the Program" offered
to the public by the Foundation or its agents or assignees shall be offered
in the form of machine-readable source code, in addition to any other forms
of the Foundation's choosing.  However, the Foundation is free to choose at
its convenience the media of distribution for machine-readable source
code.

  The Foundation promises to give or send to any one or more, or all, of
us, upon reasonable prior notice and payment of a fee or fees, each no more
than twenty times the cost of the necessary materials and postage, a copy
of any or all of the works "based on the Program" that it offers to the
public or that it has offered within the past six months, or that it
distributed for the first time within the past six months.  For works that
are programs, the machine-readable source code shall be included.  Our
request(s) shall detail whether we wish to receive all such works or
specific works.  Our choices of works to request may affect the cost and
therefore the fee(s).

  We hereby agree that if we have or acquire, or any one of us has or
acquires, hereafter any patent or interface copyright or other intellectual
property interest dominating the Program (or use of the same), such
dominating interest will not be used to undermine the effect of this
assignment, i.e. the Foundation and the general public will be licensed to
use, in the Program and its derivative works, without royalty or
limitation, the subject matter of the dominating interest.  This license
provision will be binding on our respective heirs, assignees, or other
successors to the dominating interest, as well as on each of us.

  We hereby represent and warrant that we are the sole copyright holders
for the Program and that we have the right and power to enter into this
contract.  We hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Foundation, its
officers, employees, and agents against any and all claims, actions or
damages (including attorney's reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any
party on account of a breach or alleged breach of the foregoing warranty.
We make no other express or implied warranty (including without limitation,
in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

 The Foundation reserves the right to refrain from distribution of the
Program, at its discretion, for any reason at any time.  If the Foundation
refrains from distribution, we will nonetheless be able to distribute the
Program by affixing to it copyright notices and copying permission notices
in the name of the Foundation, in a manner that the Foundation will
direct--or by exercising our right to request unlimited nonexclusive rights
as described above.

  This assignment is executed in multiple counterparts, each of which is
binding on the respective signer(s) even if other counterparts are delayed.
However, the Foundation will not begin distribution of the Program until it
has received counterparts signed by all of us.  If the Foundation does not
receive counterparts with signatures of all of us, within six months of
receiving the first counterpart, then this assignment is entirely void and
all rights revert to us.

  This assignment is deemed made in Massachusetts.

Richard Stallman, President
