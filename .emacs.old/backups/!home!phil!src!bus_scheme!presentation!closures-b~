        Lambdas are closures.

          This means they have access to variables in the
            scope in which they were defined.

          This is just like Ruby blocks, folks:

            def gimme_adder(x = 1, y = 2)
              Proc.new { x + y + z }
            end

            gimme_adder.call(3) # => 6
