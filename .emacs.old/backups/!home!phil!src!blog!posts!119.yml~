  <p>I've recently been trying to take advantage of
    the <a href='/115'>recent upswing in interest in Emacs</a> by
    working on things to help folks get started
    easily. The <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles'>personal
    dotfiles</a> I've had up have been fairly useful mostly as an
    example to which I can point folks mostly just for reference, but
    I've started a new project called
    the <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/'>Emacs
    Starter Kit</a>, which is designed to be a base from which new
    users can get going with minimal fuss. It's targeted towards
    programmers of dynamic languages.</p>

  <p>I've been using it as my main config for quite some time now, so
    it's got all the libraries I need. If you're interested in trying
    out with Emacs but don't know where to start, give this a shot. If
    you're an old hand but are curious to pick up some new tricks, try
    out the starter kit and let me know if it's missing some must-have
    functionality that you're used to.</p>

  <p>One of the key things I'm trying to do with the Starter Kit is to
    get as many libraries into ELPA as I can. ELPA is the Emacs Lisp
    Package Archive&mdash;it's basically an automated package manager
    for Emacs libraries. Without ELPA, installing libraries is all
    done by hand&mdash;only minorly cumbersome for simple libraries,
    but a nightmare when dependencies are involved.
