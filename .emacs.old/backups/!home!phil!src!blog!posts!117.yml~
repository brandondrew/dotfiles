  <p>I'm back in Seattle after an excellent RubyConf in Orlando,
    FL. These events are always a treat, and this year's was no
    exception. <a href='/96'>Last year</a> the dominant theme was
    alternate implementations, and this time around it has become an
    ingrained assumption rather than something that needs to be
    stated. Distributed version control has also graduated to
    something that can practically be taken for granted&mdash;at least
    half the slide sets referenced github repositories.</p>
  <p>But the big theme for the year was concurrency. [...]</p>
  <p>My personal favourite talk
    was <a href='http://geeksomnia.com'>John Barnette</a>
    and <a href='http://tenderlovemaking.com'>Aaron Patterson</a>'s
    talk on <a href='http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson'>Johnson</a>,
    the Ruby/Javascript bridge.</p>
