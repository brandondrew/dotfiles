# Note

This is my old dotfiles directory. I currently use the [Emacs Starter Kit](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git).

I'm keeping around this directory because I maintain a number of small
libraries here that I haven't gotten a chance to move over to their
own repositories yet. But for the most part, things in here should not
be considered the canonical copy.
