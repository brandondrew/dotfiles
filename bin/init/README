Technomancy Init
by Phil Hagelberg

This script should get you from a fresh installation to awesomely
ready (as defined by what I use). Just run go.sh as root. go.sh
should be able to fetch the other required files if it's run by
itself.

TODO:
- sync music, movies, books, photos from another machine
- panel config
- lists in gconf.yml to support ctrl:nocaps
- tell mpd.conf to look in ~/music
