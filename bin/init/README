Technomancy Init
by Phil Hagelberg

This script should get you from a fresh installation to awesomely
ready (as defined by what I use). Just run go.sh as root. go.sh
should be able to fetch the other required files if it's run by
itself.

TODO: 
- test on gutsy
- get mozlab
- sync music, movies, books, photos
- set up git.technomancy.us
- check out my projects?
- install other important libs: ruby-dbus, ruby-wm?
- panel config
- lists in gconf.yml to support ctrl:nocaps
